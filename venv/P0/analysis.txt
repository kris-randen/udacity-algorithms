Task 0
------
The runtime complexity is O(1).
Note that no matter the size of texts and calls we only pick the
first or the last elements from these lists.


Task 1
------
The runtime complexity is O(n) where n is the size of texts + the size of calls
Notice that the solution function does a constant number of operations
for each text in texts and each call in calls.


Task 2
------
The runtime complexity is O(n) where n is the size of calls.
Also the main work is done by the solution function.
Notice that for each call in calls it does a constant amount of work.


Task 3
------
The runtime complexity is O(n) where n is the size of calls.
Also the main work is done by the solution function.
Notice that for each call in calls it does a constant amount of work.


Task 4
------
The runtime complexity is O(n) where n is the size of texts + the size of calls
Notice that the solution function does a constant number of operations
for each text in texts and each call in calls.
On top of this we are doing set union and difference operations.
According to https://wiki.python.org/moin/TimeComplexity
union s|t ~ O(len(s) + len(t)) and this is O(n)
difference s|t ~ O(len(t)) which is also O(n)
